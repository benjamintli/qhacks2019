Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from [[pastoralism|pastoral]] settlements on the [[Palatine Hill]] built above the area of the future [[Roman Forum]].  Between the end of the [[bronze age]] and the beginning of the [[Iron age]], each hill between the sea and the Capitol was topped by a village (on the Capitol Hill, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC).&lt;ref name=coa9>Coarelli (1984) p. 9&lt;/ref> However, none of them had yet an urban quality.&lt;ref name=coa9/> Nowadays, there is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation (\"[[synoecism]]\") of several villages around the largest one, placed above the Palatine.&lt;ref name=coa9/> This aggregation was facilitated by the increase of agricultural productivity above the [[Subsistence economy|subsistence level]], which also allowed the establishment of [[secondary sector|secondary]] and [[tertiary sector|tertiary activities]].

Rome then began a period characterized by internal struggles between [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] (aristocrats) and [[Plebs|plebeians]] (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, [[Volsci]], [[Aequi]], [[Marsi]].&lt;ref name=awg77>Hermann &amp; Hilgemann (1964), p. 77&lt;/ref> After becoming master of [[Latium]], Rome led several wars (against the [[Gauls]], [[Osci]]-[[Samnites]] and the Greek colony of [[Taranto]], allied with [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus]]) whose result was the conquest of the [[Italian peninsula]], from the central area up to [[Magna Graecia]].&lt;ref name=awg79>Hermann &amp; Hilgemann (1964), p. 79&lt;/ref>\n\nThe third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean and the East, through the three [[Punic Wars]] (264–146 BC) fought against the city of [[Carthage]] and the three [[Macedonian Wars]] (212–168 BC) against [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name=awg8183>Hermann &amp; Hilgemann (1964), pp. 81–83&lt;/ref> Then were established the first [[Roman province]]s: [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], [[Corsica et Sardinia|Sardinia and Corsica]], [[Hispania]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].&lt;ref name=awg8185>Hermann &amp; Hilgemann (1964), pp. 81–85&lt;/ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the [[optimates]], representing the conservative part of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], and the [[populares]], which relied on the help of the [[plebs]] (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates provoked the migration to the city of a large number of people. The continuous warfare made necessary a professional army, which was more loyal to its generals than to the republic. Because of this, in the second half of the second century and during the first century BC there were conflicts both abroad and internally: after the failed attempt of social reform of the populares [[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius]] and [[Gaius Gracchus]],&lt;ref name=awg89>Hermann &amp; Hilgemann (1964), p. 89&lt;/ref> and the war against [[Jugurtha]],&lt;ref name=awg89/> there was [[Sulla's first civil war|a first civil war]] between [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Sulla]].&lt;ref name=awg89/> To this followed a [[Third Servile War|major slave revolt]] under [[Spartacus]],&lt;ref name=awg91>Hermann &amp; Hilgemann (1964), p. 91&lt;/ref> and then the establishment of the [[first Triumvirate]] with [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Pompey]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]].&lt;ref name=awg91/>\n[[File:Trajansmärkte Forum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Imperial fora]] belongs to a series of ''monumental fora'' (public squares) constructed in Rome by the emperors.

There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260-274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions – Britain, Spain, and North Africa – were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The [[Germanic tribes]] along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s-280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] in the East invaded several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.&lt;ref name=awg101>Hermann &amp; Hilgemann (1964), p. 101&lt;/ref>\nEmperor [[Diocletian]] (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the so-called [[dominate]] which tried to give the impression of absolute power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level:  whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed [[price controls]]  which did not last. He or Constantine regionalized the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Verone et la province de grande armenie, Melanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half (with residence in [[Nicomedia]]). In 296, he elevated [[Maximian]] as ''Augustus'' of the western half where he ruled mostly from [[Mediolanum]] (Current day Milan) when not on the move.&lt;ref name=awg101/> In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in Trier and Licinius in Srimium in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, Caesars succeeded and they in turn appointed to colleagues for themselves.&lt;ref name=awg101/>\n\n[[File:Piazza di porta san Paolo 102 2167.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Pyramid of Cestius|Pyramid of Caius Cestius]].]]\n[[File:Theater (Ostia Antica).jpg|left|thumb|The [[Ostia Antica]] theater.]]\n\nAfter the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power during the years 306–313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine called the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy not by changing the structure but by rationalizing the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325–330 after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East at the end of 324.The so-called [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, actually a fragment of a Letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone including to Christians and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of Byzantium into his new residence, which however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=awg103>Hermann &amp; Hilgemann (1964), p. 103&lt;/ref> The creation of Constantinople would have a profound effect on Europe: it was the bulwark against invasion and conquest from the East for 1000 years.\n\n[[Christianity]] in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380 via the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] issued in the  name of three emperors – Gratian, Valentinian II, and [[Theodosius I]] – with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395 his sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] divided the empire into [[Western Roman Empire|a western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|an eastern]] part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to [[Ravenna]] after the siege of Milan in 402. During the 5th century, the emperors from the 430s mostly resided in the capital, Rome.&lt;ref name=awg103/>\n\n[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Diocleziano (284-305 d.C.) - Foto G.

What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as art work in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot).  The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450–500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by [[Genseric]], king of the [[Vandals]].&lt;ref name=awg117>Hermann &amp; Hilgemann (1964), p. 117&lt;/ref> The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, until the deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]] on 22 August 476 marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=awg103/> The decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 on, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443; and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatized (according to \"Rome, An Urban History from Antiquity to the Present\", Rabun Taylor, Katherine W. Rinne and Spiro Kostof, 2016 pp.&amp;nbsp;160–179). However, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. Population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, population dropped to 30,000, but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.  (\"Rome, Profile of a City\": 321–1308, Richard Krautheimer, p.&amp;nbsp;165.). The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the 5th and 6th centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the 6th century and probably prevented the population from falling further (\"Rome, Urban History\", pp.&amp;nbsp;184–185.) The figure of 450,000–500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of 5 Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population. (Novel 36, 2, Emperor Valeninian III). Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Sack of Rome by Alaric - sacred vessels are brought to a church for safety (2nd of 2).jpg|thumb|right|15th-century illustration depicting the [[Sack of Rome (410)]] by the Visighotic king [[Alaric I]]]]\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the [[Pope]], was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles [[Simon Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] there. The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter, who is considered the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the [[Catholic Church]].

The driving force behind this renewal was the monk [[Ildebrando da Soana]], who once elected pope under the name of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] became involved into the [[Investiture Controversy]] against Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]].&lt;ref name=be20/> Subsequently, Rome [[Sack of Rome (1084)|was sacked and burned]] by the [[Normans]] of [[Robert Guiscard]] who had entered the city in support of the Pope, who was besieged in Castel S.

This administration, as often in the Italian cities, evolved into the [[Medieval commune|commune]], a new form of social organisation, expression of the new wealthy classes.&lt;ref name=be20/> Pope [[Lucius II]] had already to fight against the Roman commune, and the struggle was continued by his successor [[pope Eugenius III]]: then the commune, allied with the nobility, was supported by [[Arnaldo da Brescia]], a monk who was a religious and social reformer.&lt;ref name=be21>Bertarelli (1925), p. 21&lt;/ref> After the pope's death, Arnaldo was taken prisoner by [[Adrianus IV]], which marked the end of the comune's autonomy.&lt;ref name=be21/> Under [[Pope Innocent III]], whose reign marked the apogee of the papacy, the commune liquidated the senate, and replaced it with a ''Senatore'', who was subject to the pope.&lt;ref name=be21/>\n\nIn this period, the papacy played a role of secular importance in [[Western Europe]], often acting as arbitrators between Christian [[monarch]]s and exercising additional political powers.&lt;ref name=\"Faus\">Faus, José Ignacio Gonzáles. \"''Autoridade da Verdade – Momentos Obscuros do Magistério Eclesiástico''\".

Charles founded the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza]], the university of Rome.&lt;ref name=be21/> In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in [[Viterbo]], could not agree on his successor: the people of the city, angered, unroofed the building where they had met, imprisoning them until they had nominated the new pope: this happening marked the birth of the [[conclave]].&lt;ref name=be21/> In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights among the noble families: [[Annibaldi family|Annibaldi]], [[Caetani]], [[Colonna family|Colonna]], [[Orsini family|Orsini]], [[Conti di Segni|Conti]], nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.&lt;ref name=be21/>\n\n[[Pope Boniface VIII]], born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's universal domain: he proclaimed a crusade against the Colonna and, in 1300, called for the first [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee of Christianity]], which brought to Rome millions of pilgrims.&lt;ref name=be21/> However, his hopes were crushed by the French king [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], who took him prisoner and slashed him in [[Anagni]], causing his death.&lt;ref name=be21/> Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309–1377).&lt;ref name=be22>Bertarelli (1925), p. 22&lt;/ref> During this period the city was neglected, until the power fell in the hand of a plebeian man, [[Cola di Rienzo]].&lt;ref name=be22/> An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming the power with the title of ''[[Tribune|Tribuno]]'', his reforms were rejected by the populace.&lt;ref name=be22/> Forced to flee, Cola could come back among the suite of cardinal [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]], in charge of restoring the church power in Italy.&lt;ref name=be22/> Back in power for a short time, he was lynched by the populace, and Albornoz could take possession of the city, that, in 1377, under [[Gregory XI]], became again the seat of the papacy.&lt;ref name=be22/> The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the [[western Schism]] (1377–1418), and during the next forty years, the city was prey of the fights which shattered the church.&lt;ref name=be22/>\n\n===Early modern===\n{{Main|Roman Renaissance}}\n[[File:0 Castel et pont Sant'Angelo (1).JPG|thumb|right|[[Castel Sant'Angelo]] or Hadrian's Mausoleum, it's a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, here [[Pope Alexander VI]] secluded himself, from the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]] built in year 134 crowned with 16th and 17th centuries' statues.]]\n[[File:Fontana della Barcaccia restaurata, guardando verso Piazza Mignanelli.jpg|thumb|[[Fontana della Barcaccia]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1629]]\nIn 1418, the [[Council of Constance]] settled the [[Western Schism]], and a Roman pope, [[Martin V]], was elected.&lt;ref name=be22/>\nThis brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=be22/> The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from [[Nicholas V]], founder of the [[Vatican Library]],  to [[Pius II]], humanist and literate, from [[Sixtus IV]], a warrior pope, to [[Alexander VI]], immoral and [[Nepotism|nepotist]], from [[Julius II]], soldier and patron, to [[Leo X]], who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City, to the power of their stock{{clarify|date=August 2017}}, and to the patronage of the arts.&lt;ref name=be22/>\n\nDuring those years, the centre of the [[Italian Renaissance]] moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber]] since antiquity, although on Roman foundation) were created. To accomplish that, the Popes engaged the best artists of the time, including [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]]. The corruption of the Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn, the [[Counter-Reformation]]. [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]], for example, was well known for his decadence, extravagance and immoral life.&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/159/000092880/ |title=Pope Alexander VI |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212192700/http://nndb.com/people/159/000092880/ |archivedate=12 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref> Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the [[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]] by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartments]]. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503–1513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]].\n[[File:Lingelbach Karneval in Rom 001a.jpg|thumb|[[Carnival]] in Rome circa 1650]]\n\n[[File:View of the Piazza Navona, Rome LACMA 49.17.3.jpg|thumb|''A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome'', [[Hendrik Frans van Lint]], circa 1730]]\nIn this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world.

The city hosted artists like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius II. Rome lost in part its religious character, becoming increasingly a true Renaissance city, with a great number of popular feasts, horse races, parties, intrigues and licentious episodes.\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The fight between France and Spain in Europe caused the first plunder of the city in less than five hundred years after [[Sack of Rome (1084)|the previous sack]]. In 1527, the [[Landsknecht]]s of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]], putting to an abrupt end the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.&lt;ref name=be22/>\n\nBeginning with the Council of Trent in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation as an answer to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. (This loss of confidence then led to major shifts of power away from the Church.)&lt;ref name=be22/> Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus V]], Rome became the centre of the reformed Catholicism and saw the instalment of new monuments which celebrated the papacy's restored greatness.&lt;ref name=be23>Bertarelli (1925), p. 23&lt;/ref> The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.&lt;ref name=be23/>\n\nThis was another nepotistic age: the new noble families ([[Barberini family|Barberini]], [[Pamphili family|Pamphili]], [[Chigi family|Chigi]], [[Rospigliosi family|Rospigliosi]], [[Altieri family|Altieri]], [[Odescalchi family|Odescalchi]]) were protected by their respective popes, who built for their relatives huge baroque buildings.&lt;ref name=be23/> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached also the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.&lt;ref name=be22/> But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to restrain the anti-Church policies of European powers of the time, the most notable setback perhaps being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit order suppressed]].&lt;ref name=be22/>\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n[[File:Rome, a view of the river Tiber looking south with the Castel Sant'Angelo and Saint Peter's Basilica beyond by Rudolf Wiegmann 1834.jpg|thumb|[[Rudolf Wiegmann]], ''St. Peter's Basilica and [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]'', 1834]]\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798–1800), which was built under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. The Papal States were restored in June 1800, but during [[Napoleon]]'s reign Rome was [[Rome (department)|annexed as a ''Département'']] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]: first as ''Département du Tibre'' (1808–1810) and then as ''Département Rome'' (1810–1814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Church State under the pope was reinstated through the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814.\n\nIn 1849, [[Roman Republic (19th century)|another Roman Republic]] arose within the framework of the [[revolutions of 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.\n\n[[File:Breccia di Porta Pia Ademollo.jpg|left|thumb|Italian soldiers [[Capture of Rome|enter Rome]] on 20 September 1870]]\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification, as the rest of Italy was reunited as the [[Kingdom of Italy]], with a temporary capital at [[Florence]]. In 1861, Rome was declared capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the [[Papal States]] were under French protection, thanks to the foreign policy of [[Napoleon III]]. It was only when this was lifted in 1870, owing to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], that Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. Afterwards, [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself as [[prisoner in the Vatican]], and in 1871 the capital of Italy was finally moved from Florence to Rome.&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Pope Pius IX |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223209/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |archivedate=8 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref>\n\n[[File:Bombardamento di Roma.gif|thumb|right|Bombardment of Rome by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops, 1943]]\n\nSoon after World War I, Rome witnessed the rise of [[Italian Fascism]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]], who [[March on Rome|marched on the city]] in 1922, eventually declaring a new [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Italian Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]]. Mussolini pulled down large parts of the city centre in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence of classical Rome.&lt;ref>{{cite book|last1=Cederna|first1=Antonio|title=Mussolini urbanista|date=1979|publisher=Laterza|location=Bari|pages=passim|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref> The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population, which surpassed one million inhabitants. In World War II, due to its art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943 the [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo district]] was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed by Anglo-American forces]], resulting in about 3,000 immediate deaths and 11,000 wounded of which another 1,500 died. After [[25 Luglio|the fall of Mussolini]] and the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian Armistice]] on 8 September 1943, the city was occupied by the Germans and declared an [[open city]] until [[Liberation of Rome#Breakout|its liberation on 4 June 1944]].\n\nRome developed momentously after the war, as one of the driving forces behind the \"[[Italian economic miracle]]\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of ''la dolce vita'' (\"the sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecittà]] film studios. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the ''comune'' had more than 2.8 million residents. After that, population started to decline slowly as inhabitants began to move to nearby suburbs of Rome.\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|Mayor of Rome|Administrative subdivision of Rome}}\n\n===Local government===\n[[File:Campidoglio (Palacio Senatorio) September 2015-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Senatorio]] with the Rome City Hall]]\n\nRome constitutes a ''[[comune|comune speciale]]'', named ''\"Roma Capitale\"'',&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&amp;jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&amp;ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|title=Roma diventa Capitale|accessdate=6 March 2012|language=Italian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205130517/http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&amp;jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&amp;ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref> and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''comuni'' of Italy.

Each ''municipio'' is governed by a president and a council of twenty-five members who are elected by its residents every five years. The ''municipi'' frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city.&lt;br> The municipi were originally 20, then 19.&lt;ref>In 1992 after a [[referendum]] the XIX Circoscrizione became the ''[[Comune]]'' of [[Fiumicino]]&lt;/ref> In 2013, their number has been reduced to 15.&lt;ref>{{cite news|title=Roma, sì all'accorpamento dei municipi: il Consiglio li riduce da 19 a 15|url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml#|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Il Messaggero|date=11 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316064219/http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml|archivedate=16 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref>\n\nRome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', all of which are located within the [[Aurelian Walls]] except [[Prati]] and [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]].\n\nThese originate from the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|Regiones of ancient Rome]], which evolved in the Middle Ages into the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|medieval rioni]].&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |title=The \"Rioni\" of Rome |publisher=Romeartlover.it |accessdate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519060423/http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref> In the [[Renaissance]], under Pope [[Sixtus V]], they reached again the number of fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743.\n\nA new subdivision of the city under [[Napoleon]] was ephemeral, and there were no sensible changes in the organisation of the city until 1870, when Rome became the third capital of Italy. The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian walls]]. In 1874, a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati – the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] – in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city the name \"quartiere\" was used. Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').\n\n===Metropolitan and regional government===\nRome is the principal town of the [[Metropolitan City of Rome]], operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old [[Province of Rome|province]], which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]].  The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At {{convert|5352|km2}}, its dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.\n\n===National government===\n[[File:Quirinale palazzo e obelico con dioscuri Roma.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palazzo del Quirinale]], now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]]]\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] near the Olympic stadium.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nRome is in the [[Lazio]] region of [[central Italy]] on the [[Tiber]] ({{lang-it|Tevere}}) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]], the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the [[Aniene]], which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.\n\nAlthough the city centre is about {{convert|24|km|mi|0}} inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{convert|13|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]) to {{convert|139|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the peak of [[Monte Mario]]).&lt;ref>\n{{cite book\n |last1=Ravaglioli |first1=Armando\n |title=Roma anno 2750 ab Urbe condita\n |publisher=Tascabili Economici Newton\n |year=1997\n |location=Rome\n |language=Italian\n |isbn=978-88-8183-670-3\n}}&lt;/ref> The ''Comune'' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{convert|1285|km2|0}}, including many green areas.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Satellite view of Rome 2001.jpg|thumb|Satellite view of Rome]]\n[[File:Roma dall'aereo.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of Rome]]\nThroughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city's  walls. Originally, these consisted of the [[Servian Wall]], which was built twelve years after the [[Gaul]]ish sack of the city in 390 BC. This contained most of the Esquiline and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. Rome outgrew the [[Servian Wall]], but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor [[Aurelian]] began building the [[Aurelian Walls]]. These were almost {{convert |19|km|0}} long, and were still the walls the troops of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] had to breach to enter the city in 1870. The city's urban area is cut in two by its ring-road, the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' (\"GRA\"), finished in 1962, which circles the city centre at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}. Although when the ring was completed most part of the inhabited area lay inside it (one of the few exceptions was the former village of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], which lies along the Tyrrhenian coast), in the meantime quarters have been built which extend up to {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} beyond it.\n\nThe ''comune'' covers an area roughly three times the total area within the ''Raccordo'' and is comparable in area to the entire metropolitan cities of [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities. It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.\n\nAs a consequence, the density of the ''comune'' is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, [[nature reserves]], and for agricultural use.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Rome}}\nRome has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''),&lt;ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/\n |title=World Map of Köppen−Geiger Climate Classification\n |deadurl=yes\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906034159/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/\n |archivedate=6 September 2010\n |df=dmy-all\n}}&lt;/ref> with cool, humid winters and warm, dry summers.\n\nIts average annual temperature is above {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night.

Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]] (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the most high, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according to tradition. Other gods and goddesses such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], otherwise known as the Pope.\n[[File:Roma - 2016-05-23 - Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore - 2957.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], it is one of the four Papal [[major basilica]]s and it has numerous architectural styles, built between 4th century and 1743.]]\nDespite the fact that Rome is home to the [[Vatican City]] and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], located to the south-east of the city-centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total, aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include: the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu|Church of the Gesù]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]].\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant growth in Rome's [[Muslim]] community, mainly due to immigration from North African and Middle Eastern countries into the city.{{clarify |date=June 2017 |reason= How many Muslim migrants came; how many are living in Rome today?}} As a result of this increase of the local practitioners of the [[Islam]]ic faith, the ''comune'' promoted the building of the [[Mosque of Rome]], which is the largest mosque in [[Western Europe]], that was designed by architect [[Paolo Portoghesi]] and inaugurated on 21 June 1995.

There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''[[Great Synagogue of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''.\n\n===Vatican City===\n{{Main|Vatican City}}\n{{wide image|Vatikan Kolonaden Petersdom.jpg|1000px|alt=Panorama of St. Peter's Square|[[St. Peter's Square]] in Vatican City.}}\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'' ([[Vatican Hill]]), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]] of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]]/[[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]]/[[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]].\n\nWhen the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.\n\nThe territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square]], separated from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it borders Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]], which runs from the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was designed by architects [[Marcello Piacentini|Piacentini]] and Spaccarelli, for want of [[Benito Mussolini]] and in accordance with the church, after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaty]]. According to the [[Lateran Treaty]], certain [[properties of the Holy See]] located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]].\n\n===Pilgrimage===\n[[File:Petersdom bei Nacht Via della Conciliazione in Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|St. Peter's Basilica at night from [[Via della Conciliazione]] in Rome]]\nRome has been a major Christian pilgrimage site since the Middle Ages. People from all over the [[Christian world]] visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The Pope was the most influential figure during the Middle Ages. The city became a major pilgrimage site during the [[Middle Ages]] and the focus of struggles between the Papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] starting with [[Charlemagne]], who was crowned its first emperor in Rome in 800 by [[Pope Leo III]]. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as Papal capital and \"holy city\" for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309–1377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter.\n\nPilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to a large number of sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the [[scala sancta|Pilate's stairs]]: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.&lt;ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/14/wsteps114.xml Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319025615/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F06%2F14%2Fwsteps114.xml |date=19 March 2008 }}, ''Daily Telegraph'', Malcolm Moore, 14 June 2007&lt;/ref> The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by [[Helena of Constantinople|St. Helena]] in the 4th Century. For centuries, the ''Scala Santa'' has attracted Christian pilgrims who wished to honour the Passion of Jesus. Object of pilgrimage are also several catacombs built in the Roman age, in which Christians prayed, buried their dead and performed worship during periods of persecution, and various national churches (among them [[San Luigi dei francesi]] and [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]]), or churches associated with individual religious orders, such as the Jesuit Churches of Jesus and Sant'Ignazio.\n\nTraditionally, pilgrims in Rome and Roman citizens thanking God for a grace should visit by foot the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome|seven pilgrim churches]] ({{lang-it|Le sette chiese}}) in 24 hours. This custom, mandatory for each pilgrim in the Middle Ages, was codified in the 16th century by Saint [[Philip Neri]]. The seven churches are the four major Basilicas ([[Basilica of St Peter|St Peter in Vatican]], [[St Paul outside the Walls]], [[St John in Lateran]] and [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]), while the other three are [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] (a palaeochristian Basilica), [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] (a church founded by [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], the mother of Constantine, which hosts fragments of wood attributed to the holy cross) and [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]] (which lies on the [[Appian Way]] and is built above [[Catacombs of San Sebastiano|Roman catacombs]]).\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{See also|List of tourist attractions in Rome|List of streets in Rome}}\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of Rome}}\n[[File:ThePantheon.jpg|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], built as a temple dedicated to \"all the gods of the past, present and future\".]]\n[[File:Colosseo Romano Rome 04 2016 6289.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] is still today the largest [[amphitheater]] in the world.&lt;ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|title=Colosseum: The Largest Amphitheatre|work=Guinnesworldrecords.com|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref> It was used for [[gladiator]] shows and other public events (hunting shows, recreations of famous battles and dramas based on classical mythology).]]\n\nRome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern [[Fascist architecture]]. Rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of classical architecture, developing new forms such as the [[arch]], the [[dome]] and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]].&lt;ref name=\"Eyewitness\">Eyewitness Travel (2006), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref> The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and neoclassic architecture.&lt;ref name=\"Eyewitness\"/>\n\n====Ancient Rome====\n{{Main|List of ancient monuments in Rome|Ancient Roman architecture}}\nOne of the symbols of Rome is the [[Colosseum]] (70–80 AD), the largest [[amphitheatre]] ever built in the Roman Empire. Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for [[gladiator]]ial combat. A list of important monuments and sites of ancient Rome includes the [[Roman Forum]], the [[Domus Aurea]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Trajan's Column]], [[Trajan's Market]], the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]], the [[Circus Maximus]], the [[Baths of Caracalla]], [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], the [[Ara Pacis]], the [[Arch of Constantine]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the [[Bocca della Verità]].\n\n====Medieval====\nThe medieval popular quarters of the city, situated mainly around the Capitol, were largely demolished between the end of the 19th century and the fascist period, but many notable buildings still remain. Basilicas dating from the [[Early Christianity|Christian antiquity]] include [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Saint Mary Major]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious 4th century AD mosaics. Notable later notable medieval mosaics and frescoes can be also found in the churches of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], and [[Santa Prassede]]. Secular buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the [[Torre delle Milizie]] and the [[Torre dei Conti]], both next the Roman Forum, and the huge outdoor stairway  leading up to the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli|Santa Maria in Ara Coeli]].\n\n====Renaissance and Baroque====\nRome was a major world centre of the [[Renaissance]], second only to Florence, and was profoundly affected by the movement. Among others, a masterpiece of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Rome is the Piazza del Campidoglio by [[Michelangelo]]. During this period, the great aristocratic families of Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] (now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]), the [[Palazzo Venezia]], the [[Palazzo Farnese]], the [[Palazzo Barberini]], the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now seat of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]]), the [[Palazzo Spada]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]], and the [[Villa Farnesina]].\n\n{{wide image|Piazza del Campidoglio panoramic view 39948px.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of [[Piazza del Campidoglio]], with the copy of the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]].}}\n\nMany of the famous city's squares – some huge, majestic and often adorned with [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks]], some small and picturesque – got their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque. The principal ones are [[Piazza Navona]], [[Spanish Steps|Piazza di Spagna]], [[Campo de' Fiori]], [[Piazza Venezia]], [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Piazza Farnese]], [[Pantheon, Rome|Piazza della Rotonda]] and [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|Piazza della Minerva]]. One of the most emblematic examples of Baroque art is the [[Trevi Fountain|Fontana di Trevi]] by [[Nicola Salvi]]. Other notable 17th-century [[baroque architecture|baroque palaces]] are the [[Palazzo Madama]], now the seat of the [[Italian Senate]] and the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], now the seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].\n\n====Neoclassicism====\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Altare della Patria]]]]\nIn 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. During this time, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]], a building style influenced by the architecture of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], became a predominant influence in [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman architecture]]. During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. One of the best-known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II|Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II]] or \"Altar of the Fatherland\", where the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II#Unknown soldier|Grave of the Unknown Soldier]], that represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located.\n\n====Fascist architecture====\n[[File:Palazzo della civiltà del lavoro (EUR, Rome) (5904657870).jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana]]]]\n{{See also|Fascist architecture}}\n\nThe Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 had its showcase in Rome. Mussolini allowed the construction of new roads and piazzas, resulting in the destruction of roads, houses, churches and palaces erected during the papal rule. The main activities during his government were: the \"isolation\" of the [[Capitoline Hill]]; Via dei Monti, later renamed Via del'Impero, and finally [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]; Via del Mare, later renamed Via del [[Teatro di Marcello]]; the \"isolation\" of the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], with the erection of Piazza Augusto Imperatore; [[Via della Conciliazione]].\n\nArchitecturally, Fascism favored the most modern movements, such as [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]]. Parallel to this, in the 1920s another style emerged, named \"Stile Novecento\", characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. One important construction in the latter style is the Foro Mussolini, now [[Foro Italico]], by [[Enrico Del Debbio]]. Next to it, the most important Fascist site in Rome is the [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district, designed in 1938 by [[Marcello Piacentini]]. This new quarter emerged as a compromise between Rationalist and Novecento architects, the former being led by [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. The EUR was originally conceived for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 world exhibition]], and was called \"E.42\" (''\"Esposizione 42\"''). The most representative buildings of EUR are the [[Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana]] (1938–1943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of Square Colosseum, and the [[Palazzo dei Congressi]], example of Rationalist style. The world exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940, and the realised buildings were partly destroyed in 1943 during the fighting between Italian and German army after the armistice and later abandoned. The quarter was restored in the 1950s, when the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning ([[London Docklands]] and [[La Défense]] in Paris). Also, the [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the current seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.\n\n===Parks and gardens===\n[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Aesculapius (Villa Borghese)|Temple of Aesculapius]], in the gardens of the [[Villa Borghese]]]]\n{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=52 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204030918/http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=52 |archivedate=4 February 2008 |title=Green Areas |publisher=RomaPerKyoto.org |accessdate=9 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref> The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some {{convert|1.8|km2|1|abbr=out|lk=out}}. Also on the Gianicolo hill there is [[Villa Sciarra (Rome)|Villa Sciarra]], with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere the [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Roma \"La Sapienza\"|Orto Botanico]] (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees, but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush [[Villa Celimontana]], close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking [[Piazza del Popolo]] and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of [[Pincio]] and [[Villa Medici]]. Noteworthy is also the Pine wood of [[Castelfusano]], near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n===Fountains and aqueducts===\n{{Main|List of fountains in Rome|List of aqueducts in the city of Rome}}\n[[File:Fontana di Trevi Rome 04 2016 6768.jpg|thumb|The [[Trevi Fountain]], start to built in the Ancient Rome and completed in 1762 by a design of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]]]\nRome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]], in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''curator aquarum'' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.&lt;ref>Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Société d'édition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.&lt;/ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were \"a visual representation of confidence and power\".&lt;ref>''Italian Gardens, a Cultural History'', Helen Attlee. Francis Lincoln Limited, London 2006.&lt;/ref>\n\n===Statues===\n{{See also|Talking statues of Rome}}\n[[File:Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi Piazza Navona Rome 04 2016 6503.jpg|thumb|right|Fontana dei Fiumi by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1648]]\nRome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the [[talking statues of Rome]]. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]] and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]], Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]], [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]], and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de'Fiori.\n\n===Obelisks and columns===\n{{Main|List of obelisks in Rome}}\n[[File:Piazza del Popolo Obelisco Flaminio a Roma.jpg|thumb|An ancient Egyptian obelisk in [[Piazza del Popolo]]]]\n\nThe city hosts eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[obelisk]]s, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an [[Aksumite Empire|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |title=Chasing Obelisks in Rome |publisher=Initaly.com |accessdate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206125357/http://initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |archivedate=6 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref> The city contains some of obelisks in [[piazza]]s, such as in [[Piazza Navona]], [[Saint Peter's Square|St Peter's Square]], [[Piazza di Monte Citorio|Piazza Montecitorio]], and [[Piazza del Popolo]], and others in [[villa]]s, [[thermae]] parks and gardens, such as in [[Villa Mattei|Villa Celimontana]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Pincian Hill]]. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also [[Trajan's column|Trajan]]'s and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Antonine Column]], two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief. The Column of Marcus Aurelius is located in [[Piazza Colonna]] and it was built around 180 AD by [[Commodus]] in memory of his parents. The [[Column of Marcus Aurelius]] was inspired by [[Trajan's Column]] at [[Trajan's Forum]], which is part of the [[Imperial Fora]]&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roundtheworldmagazine.com/free-things-to-do-in-rome/ |title=7 Free Things To Do In Rome |publisher=roundtheworldmagazin.com |accessdate=17 January 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217200236/http://www.roundtheworldmagazine.com/free-things-to-do-in-rome/ |archivedate=17 February 2017 |df=dmy-all |date=2017-01-12 }}&lt;/ref>\n\n===Bridges===\n{{Main|List of bridges in Rome}}\n[[File:Bridge Vittorio Emanuele II at sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II]] at sunset]]\nThe city of Rome contains numerous famous bridges which cross the [[Tiber]]. The only bridge to remain unaltered until today from the classical age is [[Pons Fabricius|Ponte dei Quattro Capi]], which connects the [[Isola Tiberina]] with the left bank. The other surviving – albeit modified – ancient Roman bridges crossing the Tiber are [[Pons Cestius|Ponte Cestio]], [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]] and [[Ponte Milvio]]. Considering [[Ponte Nomentano]], also built during ancient Rome, which crosses the [[Aniene]], currently there are five ancient Roman bridges still remaining in the city.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citrag.it/archi/page/bridges/e_f_pn_ro.htm |title=The Bridges of Ancient Rome |publisher=Citrag.it |accessdate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113044759/http://www.citrag.it/archi/page/bridges/e_f_pn_ro.htm |archivedate=13 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref> Other noteworthy bridges are [[Ponte Sisto]], the first bridge built in the Renaissance above Roman foundations; [[Ponte Rotto]], actually the only remaining arch of the ancient ''Pons Aemilius'', collapsed during the flood of 1598 and demolished at the end of the 19th century; and [[Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II]], a modern bridge connecting Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Borgo. Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles. According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], which was completed in 135 AD, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] in 1688.&lt;ref>{{cite web |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |title=Sant'Angelo Bridge |accessdate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109154613/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |archivedate=9 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref>\n\n===Catacombs===\n{{Main|Catacombs of Rome}}\n[[File:PiusXItomb2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vatican Necropolis|Vatican Caves]], the place where the popes of history are buried]]\nRome has extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through [[tuff]], a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the boundaries of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|Papacy]] which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.\n\n==Economy==\nAs the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single Ministeri), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City. Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones, such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, and the German Archaeological Institute.

Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Age]]. [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook ''Opera dell'arte del cucinare'' was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].&lt;ref name=\"Rolland_1\">{{Harv|Rolland|2006|p=273}}.&lt;/ref> &lt;br> In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]], as lamb and vegetables ([[artichoke|globe artichokes]] are common).&lt;ref>Piras, 291.&lt;/ref> In parallel, Roman Jews – present in the city since the 1st century BC – developed their own cuisine, the ''cucina giudaico-romanesca''. Examples of Roman dishes include \"''[[Saltimbocca]] alla Romana''\" – a veal cutlet, Roman-style; topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; \"''[[Carciofi alla romana]]''\" – artichokes Roman-style; outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; \"''[[Carciofi alla giudia]]''\" – artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking; outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; \"''[[Carbonara|Spaghetti alla carbonara]]''\" – [[spaghetti]] with [[bacon]], [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[pecorino]], and \"''[[Gnocchi]] di semolino alla romana''\" – [[semolina]] dumpling, Roman-style, to name but a few.&lt;ref>{{cite book| last=Carnacina|author2=Buonassisi, Vincenzo | first= Luigi| title=Roma in Cucina| publisher= Giunti Martello| location = Milano| year=1975| language=Italian}}&lt;/ref>\n\n===Cinema===\n\n{{Main|List of films set in Rome|List of films set in ancient Rome}}\n[[File:Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck on Vespa in Roman Holiday trailer.jpg|thumb|''[[Roman Holiday (1953 film)|Roman Holiday]]'' with [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Gregory Peck]]]]\nRome hosts the [[Cinecittà]] Studios,&lt;ref name=\"romefile1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.romefile.com/culture/cinecitta.php |title=history of Cinecittà Studios in Rome |publisher=Romefile.com |accessdate=17 October 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501020709/http://www.romefile.com/culture/cinecitta.php |archivedate=1 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref> the largest film and television production facility in continental Europe and the centre of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian cinema]], where a large number of today's biggest box office hits are filmed.

More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot, from recent features like ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', [[Rome (TV series)|HBO's ''Rome'']], ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou|The Life Aquatic]]'' and [[Dino De Laurentiis]]' ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'', to such cinema classics as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', and the films of [[Federico Fellini]].\n\nFounded in 1937 by [[Benito Mussolini]], the studios were bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] during the Second World War. In the 1950s, Cinecittà was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with [[Federico Fellini]]. Today, Cinecittà is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and \"walk out\" with a completed film.\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Roman dialect|Latin}}\n[[File:DM TI Claudius Tiberinus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Latin]] inscription, in the [[National Roman Museum]]]]\nAlthough associated today only with Latin, ancient Rome was in fact multilingual. In highest antiquity, [[Sabine]] tribes shared the area of what is today Rome with Latin tribes. The Sabine language was one of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] group of ancient Italian languages, along with Etruscan, which would have been the main language of the last three kings who ruled the city till the founding of the Republic in 509 BC. Urganilla, or [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], wife of Emperor Claudius, is thought to have been a speaker of Etruscan many centuries after this date, according to Suetonius' entry on Claudius.  However Latin, in various evolving forms, was the main language of classical Rome, but as the city had immigrants, slaves, residents, ambassadors from many parts of the world it was also multilingual. Many educated Romans also spoke Greek, and there was a large Greek, Syriac and Jewish population in parts of Rome from well before the Empire.\n\n[[Latin]] evolved during the Middle Ages into a new language, the \"''volgare''\". The latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan dialect]] predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. The ''Romanesco'' spoken during the Middle Ages was more like a southern Italian dialect, very close to the [[Neapolitan language]] in [[Campania]]. The influence of the [[Florence|Florentine]] culture during the [[renaissance]], and above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines following the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] Popes ([[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]), caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of [[Lazio]] ([[Civitavecchia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] and others), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to improving transportation systems. As a consequence of education and media like radio and television, Romanesco became more similar to standard Italian. Dialectal literature in the traditional form of Romanesco includes the works of such authors as [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]] (one of the most important Italian poets altogether), [[Trilussa]] and [[Cesare Pascarella]]. It is worth remembering though that Romanesco was a \"''lingua vernacola''\"  (vernacular language), meaning that for centuries, it did not have a written form but it was only spoken by the population.\n\nContemporary Romanesco is mainly represented by popular actors and actresses, such as [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Aldo Fabrizi]], [[Anna Magnani]]. [[Carlo Verdone]], [[Enrico Montesano]], [[Gigi Proietti]] and [[Nino Manfredi]].\n\nRome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however. Through the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], the peoples of Italy, [[Gallia]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonization and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The [[Latin alphabet|Roman or Latin alphabet]] is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.&lt;ref>Ostler, N. (2007), ''Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin''. London: HarperCollins&lt;/ref>\n\nRome has long hosted artistic communities, foreign resident communities and a large number of foreign religious students or pilgrims and so has always been a multilingual city. Today because of mass tourism, many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially English which is widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants and so has many multilingual immigrant areas.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Stadio Olimpico 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Stadio Olimpico]], home of [[A.S.

[[Rugby union]] is gaining wider acceptance.\nUntil 2011 the [[Stadio Flaminio]] was the home stadium for the [[Italy national rugby union team]], which has been playing in the [[Six Nations Championship]] since 2000. The team now plays home games at the Stadio Olimpico because the Stadio Flaminio needs works of renovation in order to improve both its capacity and safety.\nRome is home to local rugby union teams such as [[Rugby Roma Olimpic|Rugby Roma]] (founded in 1930 and winner of five Italian championships, the latter in 1999–2000), [[Unione Rugby Capitolina]] and [[S.S. Lazio Rugby 1927|S.S. Lazio 1927]] (rugby union branch of the multisport club [[S.S. Lazio]]).\n\nEvery May, Rome hosts the [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|ATP Masters Series]] tennis tournament on the clay courts of the [[Foro Italico]]. Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the [[Giro d'Italia]] three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009. Rome is also home to other sports teams, including volleyball ([[M.

Today Rome is circled, at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the Capitol, by the ring-road (the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' or ''GRA'').\n\nDue to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is the principal railway node for central Italy. Rome's main railway station, [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]], is one of the largest railway stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day. The second-largest station in the city, [[Roma Tiburtina railway station|Roma Tiburtina]], has been redeveloped as a [[High-speed rail in Italy|high-speed rail]] terminus.&lt;ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061203063001/http://eurostar-av.trenitalia.com/it/progetto/stazioni_rinnovate/roma_tiburtina.html Entry on Roma Tiburtina station on the official website of the Italian high-speed rail service] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref> As well as frequent high speed day trains to all major Italian cities, Rome is linked nightly by 'boat train' sleeper services to Sicily, and internationally by overnight sleeper services to Munich and Vienna by ÖBB Austrian railways.\n\nRome is served by three airports. The intercontinental [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Leonardo da Vinci International Airport]] is Italy's chief airport, is located within the nearby [[Fiumicino]], south-west of Rome. The older [[Rome Ciampino Airport]] is a joint civilian and military airport. It is commonly referred to as \"Ciampino Airport\", as it is located beside [[Ciampino]], south-east of Rome. A third airport, the [[Roma-Urbe]] Airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the city centre, which handles most helicopter and private flights.\n\nAlthough the city has its own quarter on the Mediterranean Sea ([[Lido di Ostia]]), this has only a marina and a small channel-harbour for fishing boats.

These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.&lt;ref>{{cite news |title=Central Rome Streets Blocked by Taxi Drivers |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&amp;sq=Rome&amp;st=nyt |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |first=Peter |last=Kiefer |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417112759/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&amp;sq=Rome&amp;st=nyt |archivedate=17 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref> Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight.

More recently, heavy night-time traffic in [[Trastevere]], [[Testaccio]] and [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo]] has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts.\n\n[[File:Roma Metropolitana e Ferrovia 2012.png|thumb|Roma Metrorail and Underground 2016]]\n[[File:Inaugurazione metro B1.jpg|thumb|[[Conca d'Oro (Rome Metro)|Conca d'Oro]] metro station]]\nA 3-line metro system called the ''[[Rome Metro|Metropolitana]]'' operates in Rome.

The line had been planned to quickly connect the [[Roma Termini railway station|main railway station]] with the newly planned E42 area in the southern suburbs, where the 1942 [[Esposizione universale (1942)|World Fair]] was supposed to be held. The event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed [[Esposizione Universale Roma|EUR]] (Esposizione Universale di Roma: Rome Universal Exhibition) in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B Line.\n\nThe A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999–2000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. This underground network is generally reliable (although it may become very congested at peak times and during events, especially the A line) as it is relatively short.\n\nThe A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of €500&amp;nbsp;million. B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance of {{convert|3.9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nA third line, the C line, is under construction with an estimated cost of €3&amp;nbsp;billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of {{convert|25.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

It is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.\n\nRome is the seat of the so-called '''Polo Romano'''&lt;ref>[http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf parlamento.it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143221/http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref> made up by three main international agencies of the [[United Nations]]: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The [[Treaties of the EU]] are located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], due the fact that the Italian government is the depositary of the treaties. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in July 2004.\n\nRome is the seat of the [[European Olympic Committee]] and of the [[NATO Defense College]]. The city is the place where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International Criminal Court]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] were formulated.\n\nThe city hosts also other important international entities such as the [[IDLO]] (International Development Law Organisation), the [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).\n\n==International relations==\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\n{{See
